PROBLEMS

recidivism classification - predict whether likely to commit another crime

recidivism lag-time regression - predict how long until next crime committed

looking for bias in existing predictive algorithms - probably a little
controversial/overdone, although I guess we could compare/contrast a few -
not sure that's really in line with assignment

Build a classification model to predict repeat <possible demographic/regional/crime-related slicer> offenders
<with possible severity ordinal> based on <predictors> and considering the effects of <mitigators>.

PREDICTORS

individual:
gender identity
age
race
geography
dependents
education
type of crime
sentence
incarceration conditions
housing status
employment status
financial status

environmental:
food stamp availability
drug activity
quality of public education
employment conditions
quality/availability of public defenders
housing 

effectiveness of mitigators - psych treatment, legislation, shoring up
infrastructure, work/education programs - maybe doable, tough to find the
right data

FOCUS/"SLICER"
regional or urban/suburban/rural - I think we should stick within US or maybe US + Canada
age group
veterans
type of crime
type of sentence/incarceration

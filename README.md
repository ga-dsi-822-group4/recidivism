**DATA DICTIONARY**

Due to the combined length of the data dictionaries for the 3 models, they are linked separately here:

- Data dictionary for [Model 1: New York](./data/NY/data_dictionary_NY.md)
- Data dictionary for [Model 2: Florida](./data/FL/data_dictionary_FL.md)
- Data dictionary for [Model 3: Georgia](./data/GA/data_dictionary_GA.md)

**DATA ACQUISITION AND CLEANING** (Notebook is [here](./notebooks/01_data_acq_clean.ipynb))

The overall approach here was:

**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS** (Notebook is [here](./notebooks/02_eda.ipynb))

The purpose of this notebook is to "play" with a few aspects of the data, helping us to hone in on the useful columns and identify any problematic data that might cause us problems when modeling. Following are summaries/examples of the explorations conducted:

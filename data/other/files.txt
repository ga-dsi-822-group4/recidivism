State_Recidivism_Rates_All_States, 1995-2009, https://opendata.utah.gov/Public-Safety/State-Recidivism-Rates-All-States/xcyn-2ayc
covers all states, one or two years of reporting each
aggregate, qualitative data - useful for context, maybe not for modeling
groups by categories such as juvenile, sex offender, felon, etc.
does discuss interventional programs a bit - therapeutic courts, sex offender treatment, recommended sentences, etc.
lots of text to go through and interpret, even as far as recidivism quantification - again probably better for background

NIJ_s_Recidivism_Challenge_Full_Dataset (Georgia), 2013-2015, https://data.ojp.usdoj.gov/Courts/NIJ-s-Recidivism-Challenge-Full-Dataset/ynf5-u8nk
Excellent, specific individual data
gender, race, age, residence, drug tests, prior convictions, education, psych conditions, etc. - 54 columns!
has 3 columns for subsequent offenses - one for each of 3 years out from release
over 25,000 observations
great for modeling - not much on mitigators though

Recidivism__Beginning_2008 (NY), 2008-2015, https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Recidivism-Beginning-2008/y7pw-wrny
very basic individual data - just location, age, gender
over 188,000 observations - good for volume!
good characterization of recidivism - categorical variable indicating type of offense
might be useful for modeling, just doesn't have a lot of predictors

Recidivism (Kaggle), 2013-2018, https://www.kaggle.com/slonnadube/recidivism
over 96,000 observations
year, sex, ethnicity - pretty basic predictors
does include supervision, which could be a mitigator
good quantification of offenses
not sure there's sufficient target data
maybe useful for modeling

3-Year_Recidivism_for_Offenders_Admitted_to_Probation_in_Iowa, 2013-2018, http://datadiscoverystudio.org/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/3857b80ee97046d2a26df8f75b4f4072/html
Actually a duplicate of the above Kaggle!

APS_5.2_Outcome_Recidivism_by_Region_with_Demographics_FY2012-2021 (TX - agg), 2012-2021,https://data.texas.gov/dataset/APS-5-2-Outcome-Recidivism-by-Region-with-Demograp/nywn-y4pr
Aggregate data, probably mainly useful for context/background
region, age group, ethnicity, gender
recidivism calculated as % of victims from first offense to subsequent per group
probably not great for modeling

recidivism_full (Kaggle), ????-????, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uocoeeds/recidivism
Duplicate of above NIJ Recidivism Challenge!

bjs_recidivism_data.csv (Kaggle - agg by state), 2000-2016, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nathans7/bureau-of-justice-statistics-recidivism
just aggregate admissions/releases/parole violations by state, gender
probably not useful

compas (Kaggle - complex/controversial data set! FL), 2012-2014, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/compass
over 18,000 observations (I think - looks like there is 60K of raw data that was then consolidated down to 18K)
multiple files, need more research to understand which to use and exactly what columns mean
comprehensive demo info (including names - eek!!)
comprehensive offense info
could definitely be useful for modeling
would also be useful for comparing our own model to their scores
